/*
    DRI is the general term for a set of reference values
  used to plan and assess nutrient intakes of healthy people. 
  These values, which vary by age and sex, include:
  - Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): 
    Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97â€“98%)
  healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets
  for individuals.
  -Adequate Intake (AI): 
    Intake at this level is assumed
  to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is 
  insufficient to develop an RDA.
  -Estimated Average Requirement (EAR):
    Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements 
  of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient 
  intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets
  for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of 
  individuals.
  -Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to
   cause adverse health effects.
